# Source Docs for Scarborough History

## Purpose
This is a highly simplified demonstration project for use in an undergraduate classroom!  Please don't approach it as definitive information... but please *do* enjoy and improve it.  This project was initiated in December 2022 as part of a talk at [UTSC's HSC Department](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/hcs/). If you're here for the talk, please read on!

The main purpose of this repository is to give users hands-on experience writing for the web and using ismple data constructs.  It also allows us to think about how one might organize a real history of the district of Scarborough and  its predecessors.

## Instructions

During the demonstration, temporary Github credentials will be provided, but contributors are encouraged to [create their own accounts on Github](https://github.com/join). For today, ignore everything but the [articles](./articles) folder, which you can see in the code view above.  

Each file in this folder is a [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) document with a "[YAML Header](https://quire.getty.edu/docs-v1/fundamentals/#yaml-basics)}. The YAML Header appears at the beginning of the document, with two dashed lines above and below:

``` markdown

subjects: 
- political history
- gender
- etc
periods:

---

Everything after the dashed line above is markdown content.  Use **bold**, _italics_, and [link syntax](https://www.google.com/search?q=link+syntax) as you wish.  Read the syntax document for more advanced fetures. 

```
