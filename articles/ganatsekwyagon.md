**STUB**

The village of Ganatswyagon, which formerly stood near the mouth of the Rouge River, was described by French colonists as early as 1670. Discussion in most histories of Scarborough is sparse, but [this Google Scholar search](https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&inst=315209982802967212&q=Ganatsekwyagon&btnG=) links to a number of resources.  What place should this story have in a history of Scarborough? What does it say about the practice of history that this history is little-recognized?
